You typically only breathe out of one nostril at a time,"You might think that your nostrils share the workload when it comes to taking in oxygen. And while they do, it's not quite in the way that you might expect. Instead of both taking in the same amount of air when you breathe, you actually inhale most of your oxygen through one nostril at a time. Every few hours, the active nostril will take a break and the other one will take over until they ultimately switch back again. Try it for yourself!"
Vegetables do not really exist.,"When the BBC asked botanist Wolfgang Stuppy of the Royal Botanic Gardens if vegetables really exist, he answered, No, not botanically… the term vegetable doesnt exist in botanical terminology"""
More people drown in fresh water than in salt water.,"Did you know that the vast majority of drownings occur in fresh water? According to ThoughtCo, a staggering 90 percent of drownings take place in swimming pools, bathtubs, and rivers—not only because of circumstances, but also because of the way the different types of water affect the human body in potentially fatal situations."
Ravens moods are affected by others.,It's a well-known fact that ravens are wildly intelligent creatures. But 2019 research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered that the birds are also very in tune with the feelings of the creatures around them. This empathetic trait had previously only been observed in primates.
Giraffes hum to each other at night to make sure their herd stays together.,"In 2015, researchers from the University of Vienna gathered 947 hours of giraffe noises over an eight-year period at three zoos and they discovered that the animals produced a humming sound at night."
Figs aren't considered vegan because they have dead wasps inside.,"Anyone who sticks to a strictly plant-based diet will want to remove figs from their repertoire. While the figs themselves are fruit, they often include bugs. Vegan Life explains that a female ""wasp will enter the fig, passing into a part of the plant known as the calimyrna"" while trying to lay her eggs. ""Eventually, she dies… and is broken down by a protein-digesting enzyme inside the fig."""
We are born with only two innate fears,"While it might seem like you've been afraid of snakes and spiders since you were born, that's not totally true. According to CNN, scientists have found that humans have just two innate fears: the fear of falling and the fear of loud sounds. The rest of your phobias are learned over time."
Your blood makes up about 8 percent of your body weight.,"The human body contains everything from muscles and bones to organs and bacteria. But when it comes to your overall weight, you'd be silly not to consider your blood. Turns out, it makes up around 8 percent of the number you see on the scale, according to the American Society of Hematology."
"You have a 1 in 1,461 chance of being born on leap day.","Are you a leap day baby? We'd put our money on no. Due to the fact that Feb. 29 only comes around once every four years—as it did in 2020—having this birthday is incredibly rare. In fact, a person has a 1 in 1,461 chance of being born on that day. According to Vox, that's because there are 1,460 days in four years, plus one for the leap year, totaling 1,461."
"The longest one-syllable words in the English language all start with the letter ""s.""","A monosyllabic word has just one syllable. And while plenty of monosyllabic words exist, the longest ones all happen to start with the letter ""s,"" according to Guinness World Records. At 10 letters, ""scraunched"" and ""strengthed"" are the longest monosyllabic words in the English language. ""Screeched,"" ""scrounged,"" ""squelched,"" ""straights,"" and ""strengths"" come in second place with nine letters each."
Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't have a number for zero.,"If you learned Roman numerals in school, then you might've realized you were never taught the number for zero—and that's because there isn't one. While the ancient Romans (and Greeks) were fully aware of the concept of having nothing, they skipped over zero when it came to numbers. In fact, Aristotle himself is said to have dismissed the number because you couldn't divide it and get a reasonable answer, according to The Guardian."
Squirrels cause most power outages in the U.S.,"Typically, the squirrels cause problems by tunneling, chewing through electrical insulation, or becoming a current path between electrical conductors. ""Frankly, the number one threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels,"" said John C. Inglis, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency, in 2015."
You can tell the temperature by counting a cricket's chirps.,"If you're not sure what the temperature is on hot summer day, just listen to the crickets. According to the Library of Congress, the musical creatures adjust their signature sounds according to the temperature, which means that if you count how many times a cricket chirps in 15 seconds and then add 37, you'll get a number that is a pretty close approximation of the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit."
"Children of identical twins are genetically siblings, not cousins.","Cousins whose parents are identical twins share 25 percent of their DNA, instead of the usual 12.5 percent. While full-siblings share 50 percent of their DNA, half-siblings share 25 percent. That's why, though children of identical twins are legally cousins, they are genetically the equivalent of half-siblings."
There's an entire holiday dedicated to what would happen if cats and dogs had opposable thumbs.,"Have you ever wondered what your pet would be capable of if they had more practical paws? You can spend 24 hours thinking about just that on Mar. 3, which is ""What If Cats and Dogs Had Opposable Thumbs Day."" Days of the Year asks you to ""imagine a world where our favorite furry companions had thumbs. Opposable ones. Thumbs that allowed them to open their own tins of food, easily steal your possessions, and generally make them more trouble than they already are. What kind of world would that be?"" We can definitely see the pros and cons."
Cruise ships have their own morgues.,"When travelers take cruises, they're focused on the sunshine and the seawater. But those who run the ship have to consider the practical side of being out on the ocean for days at a time, and that includes what happens when someone passes away onboard. In order to deal with this unfortunate reality, most cruise ships have their own morgue that can accommodate multiple bodies."
Nomophobia is the fear of not having a mobile phone.,"People are increasingly reliant on their devices these days, but for some, the attachment can develop into a serious issue. Those with nomophobia—an abbreviation of ""no-mobile-phone phobia""—have a fear of not having their phone on them. They get equally freaked out when their battery dies or when there's no network coverage available. One 2019 study by U.K. firm YouGov found that 34 percent of men and 52 percent of women currently deal with some form of the condition."
The tiniest snail ever discovered could fit through a needle's eye 10 times.,"Snails are known for their impressive shells and slimy trails, but the Angustopila dominikae snail has also made headlines for being incredibly tiny. These itty-bitty creatures, which were discovered in 2014, are just 0.03 inches (or 0.86 millimeters) tall. That means that 10 of them could fit in the eye of a needle at one time!"
"Bamboo grows so fast, it's measured in miles per hour.","Along with being strong and flexible, bamboo can be grown as a decorative plant or a practical crop. And bamboo is also a fabulously renewable resource. In fact, it's the fastest growing plant on the planet, capable of shooting up 35 inches each day at a rate of 0.00002 miles per hour, according to Guinness World Records."
The world's smallest McDonald's was designed for bees.,"Unfortunately for hungry humans, there are no Big Macs or McNuggets available at the smallest McDonald's restaurant in the world. For bees, though, there is plenty of honey. The mini eating establishment was built in Sweden as part of the company's efforts to help restore the bee population. The hive—or rather, McHive—can not only house thousands of bees, but it's also shaped like a smaller version of the fast food joint—tiny golden arches and all."
"When there's a double rainbow, the second rainbow mirrors the primary one.","It's always exciting to spot a rainbow—but it's even more thrilling to spot a double rainbow. Frankly, you may have been so captivated by the stunning occurrence that you failed to notice a wonderfully delightful detail: The second arch displays its colors in the opposite order of the primary rainbow!"
Astronauts can now bake cookies in space.,"According to Scientific American, ""When scientists investigated the potential psychological effects of long-term missions and deep-space travel, they found things would be more bearable if astronauts have access to a good variety of foods that smell and taste a little bit more like home."" What's more, former astronaut Mike Massimino explained that preparing food boosts morale by adding ""a sense of normalcy"" to astronauts' time away from Earth. Yep, even astronauts love the smell of fresh-baked cookies!"
Bubble wrap was originally intended to be wallpaper.,"Bubble wrap was invented in 1957 by engineers Alfred W. Fielding and Marc Chavannes, who sealed two shower curtains together, creating a smattering of air bubbles, which they initially tried to sell as wallpaper. When that didn't work out, they realized their product could be used for protection in packaging, and they founded Sealed Air Corporation in 1960. When the inventors showed the product to IBM, which had just launched its first mass-produced computers, the tech company became their first big bubble wrap client. Sealed Air still exists today, creating both Cryovac food packaging and yes, bubble wrap"
3 Musketeers bars once came in three flavors.,"If you never understood where the name came from, now it can finally make sense. When the bars were created in 1932, they were sold in packs of three, each with a different nougat flavor: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. During the sugar rations in World War II, three-packs became too expensive to produce, so the company cut the retail down to one flavor. And chocolate lovers won out!"
The U.S. Navy uses Xbox 360 controllers.,"Operating periscopes on submarines is no game, but it turns out Xbox 360 controllers are lighter, more intuitive, and overall just easier to use than the complex helicopter-style control sticks Navy sailors previously used. Also, the game console controllers sell for around $20 each, while replacing a submarine industry standard controller can cost nearly $40,000. And on top of that, swapping to the Xbox controller has reduced training time from hours to mere minutes."
Charlie Chaplin once lost a Charlie Chaplin look-alike competition.,"In 1975, a few years before he passed away, Charlie Chaplin entered a look-alike contest in France. He came in third, not first. A theory as to why he didn't win is that he has blue eyes that couldn't be seen in black and white, so the judges didn't recognize him. Whatever the case, though, he was apparently a good sport about being bested."
"The leaning Tower of Pisa isn't just leaning—it's sinking, too.","Construction on the Tower of Pisa began in 1173, and, because of the soft ground it was built on, it began to lean as soon as builders got to the third story (five years after construction started). Over the next 800 years, leaning wasn't the only thing off about the tower: It's also sinking at a rate of two millimeters per year!"
Peter the Great imposed a beard tax,"Peter the Great, Russia's revolutionary czar, once imposed an annual beard tax on members of society who had facial hair. If someone wanted to keep their facial hair, they simply had to pay for it. After they made their deposit, they received a coin that said ""tax paid."" We're guessing Movember wasn't en vogue at the time."
Pluto might have a liquid ocean under its icy surface.,"Since it's so far away from the sun, Pluto was believed to be mostly covered in ice. But stunningly, even after billions of years in the frigid cold, there may still be a liquid ocean beneath that slick sheet. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Natural Geoscience, the ocean is capped and insulated by gas that might have prevented the entire body of water from freezing over."
Scents come off differently to individual people.,"A rose by any other name may be as sweet, according to William Shakespeare, but a rose may not smell the same to you as it does to other people. According to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, differences in humans' genetic codes might mean that odors come off differently to individual people."
There's an ant that only lives in a 14-block section of New York City and nowhere else on Earth.,"The ManhattAnt is found only within a 14-block section of New York City, and nowhere else on the planet. It's similar to a regular cornfield ant, but can't be matched to any other known ant species. Scientists believe that it evolved thanks to isolation within the concrete jungle. New York will clearly do things to a creature!"
